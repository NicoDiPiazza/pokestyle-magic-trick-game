Name TBD <br>

A pokemon style game about becomeing the best card magician in the world <br>
As of right now none of the sprites have been drawn up, and some other features are missing. <br>
The only known bug is the ability for the player to clip through walls/break them. <br>
I was inspired by games like pokemon and pocket mortys, with my own spin, based on a passion for card magic tricks. <br>
More files to come soon. <br>
I explect it to be built entirely in python, and one day will hopefully be a fully downloadable and playable game.
