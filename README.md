A pokemon style game about becomeing the best card magician in the world
as of right now none of the sprites have been drawn up, and some other features are missing.
The only known bug is the ability for the player to clip through walls/break them.
I was inspired by games like pokemon and pocket mortys, with my own spin, based on a passion for card magic tricks.
More files to come soon.
I explect it to be built entirely in python, and one day will hopefully be a fully downloadable and playable game.
